# define a function which will take list as a argument and this function
# will return a reversed list

# examples
# [1,2,3,4] ---> [4,3,2,1]
# ['word1', 'word2'] ---> ['word2', 'word1']

# note you simply do this with reverse method or [::-1]

# but try to do this with the help of append and pop method
